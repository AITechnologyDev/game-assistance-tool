```python
# ======================
# CONFIGURATION SETTINGS
# ======================
ANTI_RECOIL_TOGGLE_KEY = 'f1'      # Toggle anti-recoil
AIMBOT_TOGGLE_KEY = 'f2'           # Toggle aimbot
SHOOT_KEY = 'ctrl'                 # Your game's shoot key
ENEMY_COLOR = (0, 0, 255)          # BGR color of enemy indicators
COLOR_TOLERANCE = 50               # Color detection sensitivity (0-100)
SCAN_RADIUS = 300                  # Detection area around crosshair
ANTI_RECOIL_STRENGTH = 0.5         # Recoil correction strength (0-1)
```

## Usage üéÆ
```bash
python assistant.py
```
- Press **F1** to toggle Anti-Recoil
