  Automatically counters weapon recoil while preserving intentional mouse movements
- **Color-Based Aimbot**  
  Detects enemies by configurable color signatures with CPU optimization
- **AI Head Detection**  
  Uses template matching with OCR verification for precision aiming
- **Dynamic Performance Tuning**  
  Automatically reduces CPU load when not in combat
- **Hotkey Toggle System**  
  Enable/disable features instantly during gameplay
- **Cross-Platform Support**  
  Works with most popular FPS games

## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è
1. Install Python 3.8+
```bash
python --version
```
2. Install Tesseract OCR:
   - **Windows**: [Installation Guide](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)
   - **Linux**: `sudo apt install tesseract-ocr`
3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration üõ†Ô∏è
Edit the top section of `assistant.py`:
```python
# ======================
# CONFIGURATION SETTINGS
# ======================
ANTI_RECOIL_TOGGLE_KEY = 'f1'      # Toggle anti-recoil
AIMBOT_TOGGLE_KEY = 'f2'           # Toggle color aimbot
HEAD_DETECTION_TOGGLE_KEY = 'f3'   # Toggle head detection
SHOOT_KEY = 'ctrl'                 # Your game's shoot key
ENEMY_COLOR = (0, 0, 255)          # BGR color of enemy indicators
COLOR_TOLERANCE = 50               # Color detection sensitivity (0-100)
SCAN_RADIUS = 300                  # Detection area around crosshair
ANTI_RECOIL_STRENGTH = 0.5         # Recoil correction strength (0-1)
PLAYER_TEAM = 'ct'                 # Your team ('ct' or 't')
HEAD_MATCH_THRESHOLD = 0.7         # Head detection confidence (0-1)
HEAD_DIRECTORY = "Function/heads"  # Path to head templates
```

## Head Detection Setup üéØ
1. Create folder structure:
```
Function/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ heads/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ct/   # Counter-terrorist heads
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ t/    # Terrorist heads
```
2. Add head images:
   - Capture enemy head screenshots during gameplay
   - Save in appropriate team folder (PNG format recommended)
   - Filename format: `head_{map}_{weapon}.png`
3. For best results:
   - Use images with transparent backgrounds
   - Capture from different angles
   - Include various helmets/hats

## Usage üéÆ
```bash
python assistant.py
```
- Press **F1** to toggle Anti-Recoil  
- Press **F2** to toggle Color Aimbot  
- Press **F3** to toggle Head Detection  
- Use configured shoot key during gameplay  

## Performance Optimization ‚ö°
For better performance:
1. Lower `SCAN_RADIUS` value
2. Increase color tolerance if needed
3. Reduce number of head templates
4. Run as administrator for priority access
